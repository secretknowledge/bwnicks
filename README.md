# Welcome to bwnicks!

There are a lot of overlays for BedWars out there in the wide world but there doesn't really seem to be any that support Linux, which we all know is the superior choice. This project aims to port that functionality as much as possible and provide a working overlay for Linux. In the future, it may even expand further to support more gamemodes, servers, and provide more information. Enjoy!
